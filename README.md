# Windows Hardening Toolkit Project

## Project Overview
The Windows Toolkit Project is a C++ application designed to provide various system utilities, such as scanning open ports on a Windows system. This project is particularly focused on refining and applying C++ skills that have been dormant since university. The application is built using the Qt framework, leveraging its rich set of libraries for GUI development and system interaction.

### Features
- **Open Port Finder:** Scans all ports on the Windows system to identify and list open ports. It's useful for network diagnostics and monitoring system security.
